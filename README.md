EventsRegistrationWidget
========================

A Package for the Sitefinity Events Registration Widget

This widget will enable your users to easily register for your events and it will turn your existing Sitefinity website into a fully featured event management website. It connects four Sitefinity modules together:

The Forms module - where you can create your own registration form,

The Events module - within which the events are created,

The Email Campaigns module - where you can create message templates for the confirmation emails and

The Ecommerce module - in case that you want to have paid events.

Where is the registration information stored? Right in the Sitefinity database, allowing you to have access to it at any time.
